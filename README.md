# Smart Workspace
If SiYuan's workspace feature is very useful to you, but you find the overhead of switching workspaces too high, you are welcome to use this plugin.  
This plugin allows you to quickly switch between different "pseudo workspaces," enabling the display and hiding of different notebooks in various scenarios (such as studying, entertainment, development, and work).

# Please Note
Do not use this plugin for the purpose of protecting notes, as even when you are in different "pseudo workspaces," your notes remain visible on the front end.

# Usage
After installation, a button for this plugin will appear in the top bar. Through this button, you can quickly configure and activate different "pseudo workspaces."
